### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @theravee

### Welcome to my GithHub Page. For me coding is stunning cognitive-related benefits, such as problem-solving, computational thinking, analytical thinking, creative thinking, leadership-related skills, and even teamwork.  Just like hand is part of body, so the code is part of brain.

- âš¡ Fun fact: ... 
  - In the near future knowing how to code will be as necessary as knowing how to write is today. Yes, regardless of the field or career your students decide for their future.
  - The first programmer in the world was a woman. Ada Lovelace worked on analytical engine back in the 1,800â€™s. 
  - The first computer game was created in 1961. 
  - The first computer virus was created in 1983. 
  - Recent studies have shown that over 70% of coding jobs are in fields outside of technology.
  - The first programming language (per sÃ©) was called Fortran, and it was created in the â€™50s.
  - Almost any powered with electricity needs to be coded. Can you imagine?!
  - Since many programming languages share the same structure, it is easy for students to learn a new programming language once they have already mastered one before.
  - Computers run on binary code, which means that their software is written using only 1s and 0s.
